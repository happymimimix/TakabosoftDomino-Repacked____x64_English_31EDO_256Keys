<h3><a name="note_preview">How to audition a note</a></h3>
<div class=w>
Then I would like to explain how to use in order from here.<br>
<br>
If you want to check notes (=notes) before playing piano rolls on the piano roll,
Right click on the scale part you want to check with Pen tool (<img src="use_005.png" align=absmiddle width="96" height="33">).<br>
<img src="use_000.png" width="192" height="129"><br>
<br>
As long as you right-click (drag), the sound continues to sound.<br>
<br>
<div class=memo>For people without absolute pitch it is essential function (^ ^;<br>
By the way it is okay to ignore what you are writing in this frame is nothing to do with it.</div>
</div>

<h3><a name="note_put">To place a note</a></h3>
<div class=w>
To place a note, please left click on the place you want to place using Pen tool (<img src="use_005.png" align=absmiddle width="96" height="33">).<br>
Notes are placed with default strength (Velocity) and length (Gate).<br>
<img src="use_002.png" width="185" height="121"><br>
<br>
If you perform the left drag operation, you can check the sound of the scale during dragging.<br>
When you finish dragging, notes will be placed.<br>
You can cancel the placement by right clicking while dragging.<br>
<br>
Since there is an event for initializing MIDI equipment at the first measure, please place it on the second bar after the 12: 47 2010/10/19 note.
</div>

<h3><a name="play">To play</a></h3>
<div class=w>
If you can arrange notes appropriately, let's play.<br>
To play, click the [Play] button on the toolbar or press the [Space] key for troublesome people.<br>
<img src="use_003.png" width="187" height="71"><br>
<br>
<div class=memo>
Rather, the space key is the main, so we will not accept complaints that the buttons on the toolbar are small and difficult to push (^ ^;
</div>
<br>
The performance begins.<br>
When you reach the end of the input part, the performance automatically stops.<br>
<br>
If you click the [Play] button again while playing or press the [Space] key,
The performance stops.<br>
</div>

<h3><a name="play2">To play from the middle</a></h3>
<div class=w>
If you want to play from the middle of a song, left click on the header part at the position you want to play.<br>
<img src="use_004.png" width="220" height="152"><br>
<br>
Since the vertical line representing the performance position moves, if you play in this state, the performance will start from here.
</div>

<h3><a name="gate">Changing the length (Gate) of the note you placed</a></h3>
<div class=w>
To change the length (Gate) of the already placed note, use the pen tool (<img src="use_005.png" align=absmiddle width="96" height="33">)
Please hold the mouse cursor to the right end of the note you want to change.<br>
<br>
Then the mouse cursor will change to left and right arrows, please drag to the left and right in this state.<br>
<img src="use_006.png" width="113" height="57"><br>
<br>
When you finish dragging, I will confirm.<br>
<img src="use_007.png" width="152" height="50"><br>
<br>
In addition, right clicking while dragging cancels the change.<br>
<br>
You can also change the Gate by directly entering it into the Gate column of the corresponding note event in the event list pane.<br>
<img src="use_012.png" width="288" height="96"><br>
In this case, 480 is a quarter note, the larger the value, the longer it will be.<br>
By the way, if you enter directly into this event list part, you can do arithmetic operations (you can use parentheses) like "480 * 4 * 4"
Mental arithmetic is not good! Please use it for people.<br>
</div>

<h3><a name="velo">How do I change the strength (Velocity) of the note I placed?</a></h3>
<div class=w>
To change the velocity, use the event graph pane.<br>
The event graph extracts only one type of velocity, tempo, control change event
It is an area where you can display&edit graphs.<br>
<br>
First, click the [Velocity] button to display the velocity here.<br>
<img src="use_008.png" width="190" height="68"><br>
<br>
Then the bars are displayed at the same horizontal position as the note on the piano roll.<br>
<img src="use_009.png" width="234" height="275"><br>
This is a graphical representation of the velocity, the shorter the shorter the time (the smaller the value), the stronger the value (the larger the value).<br>
<br>
Then use the pen tool (<img src="use_005.png" align=absmiddle width="96" height="33">) and drag the mouse to cross the left side of the bar.<br>
<img src="use_010.png" width="113" height="123"><br>
<br>
When you finish dragging, the value of the intersecting position is reflected as velocity.<br>
(You can cancel changes by right clicking while dragging by example.)<br>
<img src="use_011.png" width="106" height="139"><br>
<br>
By the way, if you press the [Anchor display] button and display the anchor,<br>
<img src="use_059.png" width="213" height="104"><br>
Since the anchor is displayed in the velocity part, it can also be adjusted by dragging it up and down.<br>
<img src="use_178.png" width="160" height="121"><br>
<br>
You can also change Velocity by entering directly into the Vel/Value field of the corresponding note event in the Event List pane.<br>
<img src="use_013.png" width="297" height="69"><br>
<br>
Please try to suit your situation.
</div>

<h3><a name="note_move">How do I move a note I placed?</a></h3>
<div class=w>
If you want to move the note you want later, use the pen tool (<img src="use_005.png" align=absmiddle width="96" height="33">)
Move the cursor to the note you want to move.<br>
Then the mouse cursor will change to left and right arrows, so please left drag left and right up and down in this state.

When you finish dragging, I will confirm.<br>
<img src="use_014.png" width="110" height="81"><br>
<br>
You can cancel move by right clicking while dragging.<br>
</div>

<h3><a name="undo">Restoring edited content</a></h3>
<div class=w>
If you edited it by mistake, you can return the edited contents to 1st step by pressing the [Undo] button (or Ctrl + Z on the keyboard) on the toolbar.<br>
<img src="use_015.png" width="127" height="62">
<br>
(The number of times you can undo it depends on the memory usage).<br>
<br>
To redo the restored edits, press the Redo button (or Ctrl + Y on the keyboard) on the toolbar.<br>
<img src="use_016.png" width="127" height="62">

</div>

<h3><a name="snap">How to adjust snapping when placing</a></h3>
<div class=w>
I think whether you had snapped (quantized) at a certain interval when placing notes, moving them, or adjusting the gates by mouse operation.<br>
To lengthen or shorten this interval, change the Quantize combo box on the toolbar.<br>
<img src="use_017.png" width="246" height="122">
<br>
In addition, when switching on/off of this snap function,
Please press the [Tick Quantize] button, [Gate Quantize] button of the toolbar information.<br>
<img src="use_018.png" width="196" height="98"><br>
<br>
Tick ??Quantize switches whether to quantize the position when placing a note, the position when moving, etc.<br>
Gate Quantize switches whether to change the note's Gate or to quantize it.<br>
<br>
* This setting also affects the selection tool which will be explained later.<br>
<br>
You can also toggle Quantize on/off temporarily by pressing the [Ctrl] key during dragging.<br>
</div>

<br>
You can also delete it by clicking the corresponding note event in the event list pane and pressing the [Delete] key.<br>
<img src="use_020.png" width="298" height="93"><br>
</div>

<h3><a name="note_def">Changing the Initial Value of Gate&Velocity for Notes</a></h3>
<div class=w>
When placing a note with a piano roll, Gate and Velocity were arbitrarily set,
In that case, the track's "default value of Gate and Velocity of note" is used.<br>
<br>
This default value is automatically stored when you change the note's Gate or Velocity in the piano roll or event list.<br>
<br>
If you want to change this default value intentionally, adjust the Vel and Gate fields on the toolbar.<br>
<img src="use_021.png" width="227" height="58"><br>
</div>

<h3><a name="dropper">Changing the initial value of Gate&Velocity based on other notes</a></h3>
<div class=w>

</div>
<br>
The default 10 channels are automatically set to rhythm tracks,
In the case of the SC-8850, other tracks can be treated as rhythm tracks.<br>
<br>
Here, we will explain how to make 11 channels "Drum 1" or "Drum 2".<br>
<br>
First, we will make 11 channels (A11) the current track.<br>
<img src="use_096.png" width="280" height="288"><br>
<br>

<h3><a name="sync">To match the performance position with the state of the MIDI sound source</a></h3>
<div class=w>
MIDI sound generator internally holds various values.<br>
<br>
For example, play a part that is Domino, stop playing when you send Pitch Bend 4000,
If you start playing from another place again, the pitch bend value inside the sound source will remain at 4000,
It will be played at unintended intervals.<br>
<br>
Of course not only the pitch bend but also the volume and the pan pot,
There are many cases that you can not play as intended.<br>
<br>
In Domino it is possible to match the current performance position and the state of the MIDI sound source to some extent.<br>
<br>
To match the state, select [Match MIDI equipment state] from the [Play] menu.<br>
<img src="use_136.png" width="296" height="519"><br>
<br>
Parameters whose states match are different depending on the sound source definition file,

<br>
In addition, it is possible to adjust the state automatically.<br>
To automate, select "Match MIDI equipment state automatically" from the "Play" menu.<br>

<h3><a name=" param">To use variables</a></h3>
<div class=w>
Variables can be used for the Gate field, Vel/Value field, and tempo of the control change event.<br>
<br>
<div class=memo>
I think that it is better to stay in the usage of "constant" rather than "variable".<br>
Many of the things I tried to make are not very convenient.<br>
</div>
<br>
For example, A melody Å® B melody Å® rust Å® A melody Å® B melody Å® rusty<br>
Suppose you have a song composition such as A, Mero, 50 Volume, B Mero is supposed to be Volume 60.<br>
If you normally set the volume without using a variable,<br>
A Melo (Vol=50) Å® B Mero (Vol=60) Å® Rust Å® A Mero (Vol=50) Å® B Mero (Vol=60) Å® Sabi
I think whether to insert an event on each occasion like that.<br>
<br>
However, in this case, if you want to change the volume of A melody to 55, you have to fix two places.<br>
(It's fine if you have two places but it will be tough when this becomes so much)<br>
<br>
Therefore, using variables, "a_vol=50" and "b_vol=60" are defined in advance,
If you specify it as the value of the Volume (Part Level) event,
When you want to change the volume of A melody later, you can just modify "a_vol=55".<br>
<br>
To actually define a variable, select [Variable Table] from the [Edit] menu.<br>
<img src="use_139.png" width="339" height="629"><br>
<br>
Since all the variables existing in memory are displayed,
Write the variable you want to use in the format "variable name=value" line by line.<br>
<img src="use_138.png" width="546" height="411"><br>
(We will distinguish between full-width and half-width variable names, but we do not distinguish between upper case and lower case letters, or it will be lowercase.)<br>
<br>
After that, you can use it by directly entering the variable name in the Vel/Value field of the control change event.<br>
<img src="use_140.png" width="298" height="149"><br>
<br>
Since the effective range of this variable is all tracks in the file, if you simply use a name like a_vol there,
If you want to do something similar on other tracks, you may be in trouble ^ ^ ;;<br>
<br>
<div class=memo>
Incidentally, there are variable events, but this is an event that you can define and recalculate variables during playing.
However, since it is not compatible with the [Match state of MIDI device] function, it is better to avoid using variable events when using that function.

<h3><a name="eot">How do I adjust the end position of a song?</a></h3>
<div class=w>
There is an event (End of Track) indicating the end position of the track for each track,
The End of Track, which is the last in time on all tracks, is the end position of the song.<br>
<br>
Even though the performance has ended, the performance has not ended for a while,
On the contrary, when the end position of the song is too early (after writing it as a midi file) and the performance ends before the sound is finished,
You can solve it by adjusting the playing position.<br>
<br>
To adjust the end position of the song, set the position you want to be in the end position to the performance position.<br>
<br>
Then select [Adjust End of Track] from the [Event] menu.<br>
<img src="use_152.png" width="320" height="631"><br>
<br>
This will rearrange the End of Track events for all tracks to the playing position.<br>
(Of course, if you have an event behind you can not relocate ^ ^;)<br>
